# Progress UI Tasks


# How to run?
Go to root folder of each task and run this:
  - npm i (install npm packages)
  - npm run start (runs webpack dev server)

P.S. I wlould like to add some coments about the implementation or even better to talk with you about it.

To-do:
* Task 1 - implement real callback (onBeforeOpen, onAfterOpen, onBeforeClose, onAfterClose)
* Task 1 - fix body coteiners do not resize on window width change
* Task 1 - fix some bugs

Thank you!
